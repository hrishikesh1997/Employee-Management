# Employee Management API

This project is a Node.js-based Employee Management API built using **Express.js** and **Sequelize** (an ORM for working with relational databases). The API provides endpoints to manage employees, their roles, and departments.

## Features

- **CRUD Operations**: Create, read, update, and delete employees.
- **Database Seeding**: Populate the database with sample data for roles, departments, and employees.
- **Role and Department Management**: Retrieve employee details by roles and departments.
- **Sorting and Filtering**: Sort employees by name and fetch data by department or role.
- **Relational Data Handling**: Associate employees with departments and roles.

## Installation and Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-folder>
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Ensure Node.js and npm are installed. Then run:
   ```bash
   npm install express sequelize sqlite3 
   ```

3. **Configure Database**:
   Update the database configuration in `lib/index.js` to connect to your database.

4. **Run the Application**:
   Start the server:
   ```bash
   node index.js
   ```
   The server will run at `http://localhost:3010`.
